# Early Access Program

**InfraSpec** is a tool for testing your cloud infrastructure written in Go that allows users to write infrastructure
tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax. The project tests infrastructure code for Terraform, Docker, and
Kubernetes without requiring users to write traditional test code using frameworks like Terratest.

## Features

- Scan infrastructure code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests) for security and compliance issues
- Get actionable recommendations to fix detected problems
- Integrate with your existing CI/CD pipeline
- Track infrastructure changes and drift over time
- Enforce organizational policies and best practices

## Benefits

- Prevent costly misconfigurations before they reach production
- Ensure compliance with security standards and regulations
- Reduce manual review time and effort
- Standardize infrastructure practices across teams
- Catch issues early in the development lifecycle
