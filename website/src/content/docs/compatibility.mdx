# AWS Compatibility

This page shows the implementation status of AWS services in InfraSpec. We support two modes of operation:

- **InfraSpec Assertions** - Test assertions that verify your infrastructure configuration against real AWS resources or the Virtual Cloud
- **Virtual Cloud** - A local AWS emulator that allows you to test infrastructure without deploying to real AWS

## Service Status

Click on any implemented service to see detailed operation-level support.

## About Coverage

### InfraSpec Assertions

InfraSpec assertions are high-level test functions designed for infrastructure validation. Each assertion maps to one or more AWS API calls and provides meaningful error messages when validation fails.

Example assertions:
- `AssertBucketExists` - Verifies an S3 bucket exists and is accessible
- `AssertDBInstanceStatus` - Checks the status of an RDS database instance
- `AssertTableTags` - Validates DynamoDB table tags match expected values

### Virtual Cloud

The Virtual Cloud is an AWS-compatible API server that emulates AWS services locally. It allows you to:

- Run infrastructure tests without AWS credentials
- Test faster with no network latency to AWS
- Avoid AWS costs during development and testing
- Run tests in CI/CD without cloud access

Coverage percentage indicates how many AWS API operations are implemented compared to the total available in the AWS SDK.

## Requesting New Services

If you need support for an AWS service that isn't listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/robmorgan/infraspec/issues) on GitHub. We prioritize services based on community demand.
