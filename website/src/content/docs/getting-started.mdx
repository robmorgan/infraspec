# Getting Started

InfraSpec automatically generates executable test code from your plain English specifications, eliminating the need to
write traditional test code yourself. When you describe your infrastructure requirements using Gherkin syntax,
InfraSpec's intelligent step definitions translate your natural language into real infrastructure actions and
validations.

For example, when you write a simple assertion like:

```gherkin
Then the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have an encryption configuration
```

InfraSpec automatically:

- Generates the underlying test code to connect to AWS
- Parses the S3 bucket configuration
- Validates encryption settings against AWS APIs
- Provides clear, actionable error messages if validation fails

This means you can focus on **what** to test rather than **how** to test it. The tool handles all the complexity of API
calls, retries, error handling, and result formatting automatically. You write the specifications, and InfraSpec
generates the executable tests that run against your infrastructure.

## Getting started

<Steps>
### Install InfraSpec

Choose how you want to install InfraSpec:

<Tabs items={["Homebrew", "Prebuilt Binaries"]}>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    brew tap robmorgan/infraspec
    brew install infraspec
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/robmorgan/infraspec/releases)</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Initialize a Repo

Initialize a Git repo containing your infrastructure code:

```sh
infraspec init # This will create a ./features directory if it doesn't already exist
```

### Create a Simple Terraform Example

Copy and paste the following into a Terraform configuration:

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy
output "hello_world" {
  description = "Hello World"
  value       = "Hello, World!"
}
```

### Create Your First Test

Create your first test scenario:

```sh
infraspec new terraform.feature
```

### Copy the feature code

Copy and paste the following into the `terraform.feature`:

```gherkin filename="terraform.feature" copy
Feature: Terraform Hello World

  Scenario: Run a simple test
    Given the Terraform module at "../examples/terraform/hello-world"
    When I run terraform apply
    Then the "hello_world" output is "Hello, World!"
```

### Run it!

```sh
infraspec features/terraform.feature
```

You should see some output.
