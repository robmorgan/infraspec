# What is InfraSpec?

InfraSpec is a CLI tool for testing your Terraform AWS infrastructure in plain English, without writing a single line of
code. It combines a rich library of testing patterns with a domain-specific language for testing cloud infrastructure.

Tests are written using easy-to-learn [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax, which is suitable for both
technical and non-technical team members. This approach contrasts sharply with existing tools like Terratest and
Kitchen-Terraform, which require significant programming expertise.

## The Problem

Traditional infrastructure testing tools require you to write code in programming languages like Go (Terratest) or Ruby
(Kitchen-Terraform). This creates a barrier for infrastructure engineers who want to test their infrastructure but
aren't comfortable with these languages. Writing test code also means maintaining boilerplate, handling API calls,
retries, and error handling yourself.

## The Solution

InfraSpec lets you write tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax. You describe what you want to test, and InfraSpec
automatically translates your specifications into executable infrastructure tests. You focus on **what** to test, not
**how** to test it.

Here's an example of testing a Terraform S3 bucket configuration:

```gherkin
Feature: S3 Bucket Creation
  As a DevOps Engineer
  I want to create an S3 bucket with guardrails
  So that I can store my data securely

  Scenario: Create an S3 bucket with a name
    Given I have a Terraform configuration in "./s3-bucket"
    And I set variable "bucket_name" to "my-bucket"
    When I run Terraform apply
    Then the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should exist
    And the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have a versioning configuration
    And the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have a public access block
    And the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have a server access logging configuration
    And the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have an encryption configuration
```

InfraSpec automatically handles:

- Connecting to AWS APIs
- Parsing Terraform configurations
- Executing Terraform commands
- Validating resource states and configurations
- Error handling and retries
- Cleanup of test resources

## Key Benefits

### Plain English Syntax

Write tests that read like documentation. The Gherkin syntax is intuitive and requires no programming knowledge. Tests
are self-documenting and serve as living specifications.

### Team-Friendly

Non-technical stakeholders can read and even author tests. This improves collaboration between developers, DevOps
engineers, product managers, and compliance teams. Everyone can understand and contribute to infrastructure quality
standards.

### Minimal Setup

No complex frameworks to integrate. InfraSpec works with your existing Terraform configurations and AWS resources.
Simply initialize a repository and start writing tests.

### Rich Grammar Library

InfraSpec comes with hundreds of built-in test steps (patterns) for common scenarios. You don't need to write low-level
assertions for:

- Resource existence and configuration
- Security settings and compliance checks
- Networking rules and connectivity
- Cost optimization patterns

### Fast Feedback

Catch infrastructure issues early, before they reach production. Run these tests locally during development or integrate
them into your CI/CD pipeline for automated validation.

## What Can You Test?

InfraSpec supports testing:

**🏗️ Terraform Infrastructure**

- Resource configurations and relationships
- Security policies and compliance
- Cost optimization rules
- Multi-environment consistency

**☁️ AWS Services**

- DynamoDB tables
- RDS DB instances
- S3 bucket configurations
- More services coming soon

**🌐 HTTP Endpoints**

- HTTP(s) endpoints
- Form data handling
- File uploads

## How It Works

InfraSpec uses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles. Your Gherkin feature files are parsed and matched against
step definitions that execute real infrastructure actions. When you write a step like:

```gherkin
Then the S3 bucket "my-bucket" should have an encryption configuration
```

InfraSpec:

1. Generates the code to connect to AWS
2. Retrieves the bucket configuration
3. Validates the encryption settings
4. Reports clear, actionable results

All of this happens automatically—no code required on your part.
