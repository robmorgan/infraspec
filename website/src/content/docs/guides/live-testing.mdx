# Live Testing on AWS

InfraSpec can run tests against real AWS APIs, allowing you to test your infrastructure code against a live AWS
environment. This is useful for end-to-end validation in actual AWS environments or for testing production-like
configurations.

## Getting started

To get started, you need to have a valid AWS account and credentials. You can use the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to configure your AWS credentials. For other configuration options, see
the [Configuring AWS Credentials](/docs/providers/aws/configure) page.

## Cleaning Up

While InfraSpec attempts to clean up all resources after test execution including failures, unexpected errors or network
interruptions may leave residual infrastructure. Running [cloud-nuke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke)
nightly in a dedicated test AWS account provides a reliable backstop for removing any orphaned resources.
