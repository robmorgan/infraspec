# Terraform Provider Overview

InfraSpec's Terraform provider enables you to provision infrastructure using Terraform and test it with natural language
scenarios. You can run `terraform apply`, validate outputs, and combine Terraform with provider-specific assertions for
comprehensive infrastructure testing.

## Capabilities

- **Provision Infrastructure**: Execute `terraform init` and `terraform apply` automatically
- **Variable Management**: Set variables using multiple formats (strings, numbers, booleans, maps)
- **Output Validation**: Verify Terraform outputs with exact or partial matching
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any Terraform configuration regardless of cloud provider
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Resources are automatically destroyed after tests complete
- **Integration**: Seamlessly combines with AWS, HTTP, and other provider assertions

## How It Works

InfraSpec integrates Terraform operations directly into your Gherkin scenarios. When you write a step like:

```gherkin
When I run Terraform apply
```

InfraSpec automatically:

1. Runs `terraform init` to initialize the configuration
2. Executes `terraform apply` with your provided variables
3. Parses Terraform outputs for validation
4. Tracks applied resources for cleanup
5. Destroys resources after the scenario completes

All Terraform commands are executed in isolated working directories, ensuring test isolation.

## Configuration

No special configuration is required for Terraform support. Simply ensure:

- Terraform is installed and available in your `PATH`
- Your Terraform configurations are valid
- Required provider credentials are configured (e.g., AWS credentials for AWS resources)
