# AWS Provider Overview

InfraSpec's AWS provider allows you to validate AWS cloud resources easily using natural language scenarios written in
Gherkin syntax. You can test your infrastructure directly in AWS or as part of Terraform-managed deployments.

## Supported Services

The AWS provider currently supports testing for three core AWS services:

- **S3** - Simple Storage Service buckets
- **RDS** - Relational Database Service instances
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database tables

Each service provides comprehensive assertions for existence, configuration, security settings, and compliance checks.

## Configuring AWS Credentials

InfraSpec uses the AWS SDK's standard credential chain. Credentials can be configured through:

- Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
- AWS profiles (`AWS_PROFILE`)
- IAM role assumption (`INFRASPEC_IAM_ROLE`)
- Container/IAM roles when running on EC2 or ECS
