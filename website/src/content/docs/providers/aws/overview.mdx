# AWS Provider Overview

InfraSpec's AWS provider allows you to validate AWS cloud resources easily using natural language scenarios written in
Gherkin syntax. You can test your infrastructure using the embedded AWS emulator (default) or against real AWS.

## Supported Services

InfraSpec emulates **9 AWS services** with varying levels of API coverage:

| Service | Operations | Coverage | Description |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **STS** | 10/11 | 90% | Security Token Service - identity and credentials |
| **SQS** | 16/23 | 69% | Simple Queue Service - message queuing |
| **IAM** | 105/176 | 59% | Identity and Access Management - roles, policies, users |
| **DynamoDB** | 33/57 | 57% | NoSQL database tables and items |
| **S3** | 23/106 | 21% | Simple Storage Service - buckets and objects |
| **Lambda** | 56/85 | 65% | Serverless functions, versions, aliases, URLs, layers |
| **EC2** | 47/749 | 6% | Elastic Compute Cloud - instances, VPCs, security groups |
| **RDS** | 9/163 | 5% | Relational Database Service - database instances |
| **Auto Scaling** | 14/18 | 77% | Application Auto Scaling - scaling policies and targets |

### Service Highlights

- **Lambda** - Full support for functions, versions, aliases, function URLs, layers, event source mappings, and concurrency
- **IAM** - Comprehensive support including 25+ AWS managed policies, roles, users, groups, and instance profiles
- **DynamoDB** - Complete table operations, item CRUD, queries, scans, and GSI/LSI support
- **S3** - Bucket operations, object storage, versioning, encryption, and public access blocks
- **EC2** - Core instance lifecycle, VPCs, subnets, security groups, and key pairs

## Configuring AWS Credentials

InfraSpec uses the AWS SDK's standard credential chain. Credentials can be configured through:

- Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
- AWS profiles (`AWS_PROFILE`)
- IAM role assumption (`INFRASPEC_IAM_ROLE`)
- Container/IAM roles when running on EC2 or ECS
