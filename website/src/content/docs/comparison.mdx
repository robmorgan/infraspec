# How InfraSpec Compares

InfraSpec's plain-English approach contrasts sharply with existing tools like Terratest and Kitchen-Terraform, which
require significant programming expertise. Terratest is essentially a Go library for testing infrastructure that
developers embed in Go test files, making it challenging for many infrastructure engineers who aren't comfortable
writing Go. Similarly, Kitchen-Terraform combines Ruby, InSpec, and Test Kitchen, creating a steep learning curve that
limits testing to those familiar with the Ruby ecosystem.

On the other hand, InfraSpec is a higher-level CLI tool where you write Gherkin feature files instead of codeâ€”this BDD
style is dramatically more accessible. It lowers the skill barrier for creating infrastructure tests. While Terratest
and Kitchen-Terraform require you to write test logic and assertions manually, InfraSpec automatically translates your
plain-language specifications into real infrastructure actions and validations, giving you similar benefits (like
validating Terraform deployments) without writing any code.
