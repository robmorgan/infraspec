# Telemetry

InfraSpec collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. This data helps us understand how the tool is being
used and identify areas for improvement.

## What data is collected?

- Command usage patterns
- Feature file execution statistics
- Error events (without sensitive data)
- System information (OS, architecture)
- Performance metrics (execution duration, step counts)

## What data is NOT collected?

- File contents or names
- Infrastructure details
- Personal information
- Sensitive configuration data

## How to disable telemetry

You may opt out by specifying the following flag:

```bash
infraspec --disable-telemetry my.feature
```

You can also opt out by setting any of the following environment variables:

- `INFRASPEC_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (Learn more about [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/))
