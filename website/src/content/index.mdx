# Welcome to InfraSpec

ðŸš€ Coming soon! In the mean time check out: https://github.com/robmorgan/infraspec or the quick start below.

## Quick start

You can test the early development versions of InfraSpec using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

> [!WARNING]
>
> InfraSpec is still under active development and is likely to change significantly in the near future. Some features
> may not be implemented yet or work as expected. Thank you for your early participation and feedback!

1. Install InfraSpec using Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap robmorgan/infraspec
brew install infraspec
```

2. Initialize a repo containing your infrastructure code:

```sh
infraspec init # creates a ./features directory if it doesn't already exist
```

3. Create your first infrastructure test:

```sh
infraspec new dynamodb.feature
```

4. Run the tests

```sh
infraspec features/dynamodb.feature
```

> [!TIP]
>
> If your using VS Code, we recommend installing the [Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete)
> extension for syntax highlighting.
