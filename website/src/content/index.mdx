InfraSpec is a CLI tool for testing your Terraform AWS infrastructure code in plain English, without writing a single
line of code. It combines a rich library of testing patterns with a domain-specific language for testing cloud
infrastructure.

Tests are written using easy-to-learn [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax, which is suitable for both
technical and non-technical team members. This approach constrasts sharply with existing tools which require significant
programming expertise.

## Features

- 🗣️ **Plain English syntax.** Write tests that read like sentences, not code. InfraSpec uses easy-to-learn Gherkin
  syntax for defining test steps
- 👥 **Team-friendly.** Non-technical stakeholders can read and even author tests, improving collaboration on
  infrastructure requirements
- 🚀 **Minimal setup.** No complex frameworks to integrate. InfraSpec works with your existing Terraform configurations
  and AWS resources.
- 📚 **Rich Grammar Library.** Comes with hundreds of built-in test steps (patterns) for common scenarios (e.g. resource
  existence, security settings, networking rules) so you don't have to write low-level assertions
- ⚡️ **Fast feedback.** Catch infrastructure issues early, before they reach production, by running these tests in
  CI/CD or locally as part of your workflow.

## Quick start

InfaSpec can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (preferred), downloaded as a pre-built binary, or built from
source.

#### Homebrew

1. Install InfraSpec using Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap robmorgan/infraspec
brew install infraspec
```

2. Initialize a repo containing your infrastructure code:

```sh
infraspec init # creates a ./features directory if it doesn't already exist
```

3. Create your first infrastructure test:

```sh
infraspec new dynamodb.feature
```

4. Run the tests

```sh
infraspec features/dynamodb.feature
```

<Callout type="info">
  If your using VS Code or Cursor, we recommend installing the [Cucumber (Gherkin) Full
  Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) extension for syntax
  highlighting.
