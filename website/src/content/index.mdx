Testing infrastructure code shouldn't require learning complex testing frameworks or writing hundreds of lines of code.
InfraSpec lets you write infrastructure tests in **plain English** using the battle-tested Gherkin syntax.

Traditional infrastructure testing solutions like Terratest require programming knowledge, so writing tests can take
as long as writing the infrastructure itself. InfraSpec focuses on **intent**. Tests read like documentation, are easy
to review, and remain understandable over time. This makes collaboration possible not just for engineers, but also for
platform, security, and compliance stakeholders.

InfraSpec runs tests against a [built-in virtual cloud emulator](/docs/virtual-cloud) for fast, deterministic local and CI workflows, or
against real AWS APIs for end-to-end validation. Pre-built testing patterns and natural-language specifications ensure
tests remain readable, maintainable, and executable from day one.

## Features

- 🗣️ **Plain English syntax** - Write tests that read like documentation using Gherkin
- ⚡️ **Fast feedback** - 10-100x faster than creating real AWS infrastructure
- 👥 **Team-friendly** - Non-technical stakeholders can read, review, and contribute
- 🚀 **Zero boilerplate** - Works with your existing Terraform configurations out of the box
- 📚 **Rich assertion library** - Hundreds of pre-built assertions for AWS resources
- 🔄 **CI/CD ready** - Integrates seamlessly with your existing pipelines
- 💰 **Cost effective** - Built-in emulator eliminates AWS testing costs
- 🧪 **Flexible testing** - Test against real AWS or the Virtual Cloud emulator

## Quick start

InfaSpec can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (preferred), downloaded as a pre-built binary, or built from
source.

#### Homebrew

1. Install InfraSpec using Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap robmorgan/infraspec
brew install infraspec
```

2. Initialize a repo containing your infrastructure code:

```sh
infraspec init # creates a ./features directory if it doesn't already exist
```

3. Create your first infrastructure test:

```sh
infraspec new dynamodb.feature
```

4. Run the tests

```sh
infraspec features/dynamodb.feature
```

  If your using VS Code or Cursor, we recommend installing the [Cucumber (Gherkin) Full
  Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) extension for syntax
  highlighting.

#### Download prebuilt binaries

Currently, the following binaries are provided:

- Mac (Apple Silicon)
- Mac (x64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Linux (aarch64)
- Windows (win32-x64)
- Windows (ia32)

You can download them directly from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/robmorgan/infraspec/releases).

#### Building from Source

InfraSpec requires at least [Go 1.24.4](https://go.dev) to build from source.

To directly install, use:

```sh
go install github.com/robmorgan/infraspec@latest
```

Otherwise:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robmorgan/infraspec.git
go build ./cmd/infraspec
```
