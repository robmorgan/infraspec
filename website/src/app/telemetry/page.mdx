# Telemetry

InfraSpec collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. This data helps us understand how the tool is being
used and identify areas for improvement.

## What data is collected?

- Command usage patterns (e.g. which InfraSpec commands or options are used)
- Feature file execution statistics (e.g. how many scenarios, average runtime)
- Error events (non-sensitive information about failures)
- Basic system info (OS type, CPU architecture)
- Performance metrics (execution durations, number of steps)

## What data is NOT collected?

InfraSpec **does not** collect any of your actual infrastructure code or confidential details. For example:

- No file contents or names of your infrastructure files
- No details about your cloud resources (IDs, configurations, etc.)
- No personal identifying information
- No sensitive environment variables or secrets

## How to disable telemetry

You may opt out of telemetry by setting any of the following environment variables:

- `INFRASPEC_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (Learn more about [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/))
