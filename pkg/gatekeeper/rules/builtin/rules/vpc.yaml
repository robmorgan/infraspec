      Enable VPC flow logs for your VPC:

      resource "aws_flow_log" "example" {
        iam_role_arn    = aws_iam_role.flow_log.arn
        log_destination = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.flow_log.arn
        traffic_type    = "ALL"
        vpc_id          = aws_vpc.main.id
      }

      Note: Flow logs help with network troubleshooting and security analysis.

    remediation: |
      Remove all rules from the default security group:

      resource "aws_default_security_group" "default" {
        vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

        # No ingress or egress rules - use explicit security groups instead
      }

      Create dedicated security groups for your resources instead of using the default.
