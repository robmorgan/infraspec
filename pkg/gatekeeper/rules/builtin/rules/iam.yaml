    name: "IAM role should not have inline policy"
    description: "IAM roles should use managed policies instead of inline policies for better governance"
    severity: warning
    resource_type: aws_iam_role
    condition:
      attribute: inline_policy
      operator: not_exists
    message: "IAM role '{{.resource_name}}' has an inline policy - use managed policies instead"
    remediation: |
      Replace inline policies with managed policies:

      resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "example" {
        role       = aws_iam_role.{{.resource_name}}.name
        policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.example.arn
      }

      Benefits of managed policies:
      - Reusable across multiple roles
      - Version controlled
      - Easier to audit and update

    name: "IAM policy should not use wildcard actions"
    description: "IAM policies should use specific actions instead of wildcards for least privilege"
    severity: error

    condition:
      operator: not
      conditions:
        - attribute: policy
          operator: contains

    remediation: |
      Replace wildcard actions with specific actions:

      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
          }
        ]
      }

      Use the principle of least privilege - only grant actions that are needed.

    name: "IAM policy should not use wildcard resources"
    description: "IAM policies should specify resources instead of using wildcards"
    severity: warning

    condition:
      operator: not

          operator: contains

    message: "IAM policy '{{.resource_name}}' uses wildcard (*) resources"
    remediation: |
      Replace wildcard resources with specific ARNs:

      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::my-other-bucket/*"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

      Note: Some actions require Resource: "*" (e.g., s3:ListAllMyBuckets).
      Use condition keys to further restrict access when possible.
